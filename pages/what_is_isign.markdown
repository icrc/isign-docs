# What is iSign

The Institutional Electronic Signature Solution, known as "iSign," aims to provide the ICRC with a unified electronic signature solution that adheres to ICRC standards for security and compliance, particularly in legal and data protection matters.

## How iSign fits into the ICRC ecosystem?

iSign is a cloud-based software validated through a Cloud Risk Assessment. Data and documents classified up to CONFIDENTIAL can be signed using iSign. This means **documents marked as Strictly Confidential must NOT be signed with iSign and should be signed manually**.

For now, iSign is installed in a 'standalone' mode, meaning it is not integrated with any ICRC solutions. In future versions, we plan to integrate iSign with SharePoint/Collaborative Spaces or other solutions based on user needs and priorities to reduce 'digital disruption.'

# What is an electronic signature (eSignature)

"Electronic signature" is a broad term. In the context of the ICRC (and based on Gartner's 2020 market guide), we use the following terminology:

- Electronic signature (any digital representation of an individual’s agreement) : An electronic symbol or process attached to an agreement and executed or accepted by a person with the intend to sign the agreement or record. Examples include clicking an Accept button online, signing on a touch pad to approve a credit card purchase or typing one's name on a signature line.
- Digital signature (assimilated handwritten signature): a type of electronic signature that uses an encrypted digital certificate to authenticate the identity of a signer. Digital signatures are sometimes referred to as advanced electronic signatures, qualified electronic signatures or other terms depending on the jurisdiction.

## Different types of Digital Signatures

- **Simple (or Basic) Electronic Signature (SES)**: This type of electronic signature, sometimes called “standard” or “simple,” does not use digital certificates. Some countries (mostly Anglo-Saxon ones) widely adopt click-to-sign because the legal framework for e-signatures in these countries is technology-neutral. This type of signature is easy to implement and has a low impact on user experience.
- **Advanced Electronic Signature (AES)**: This type of signature uses self-acquired digital certificates assigned to each signer, providing a high level of safeguarding against tampering or alteration after the document has been signed.
- **Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)**: The EU, along with countries in the Asia/Pacific region, the Middle East, mainland Europe, and South America, is more prescriptive in how e-signature technology can be used. They may require qualified e-signatures that rely on qualified digital signatures for certain use cases. This requires a standards-based process to assign a digital certificate to an individual, based on a digital ID validated by a government- or industry-sponsored identity proofing scheme. Certificates are provided either on a physical identity card or through a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP). Each digital ID process is typically unique to that country, and some countries may have multiple schemes in use. It is important to ensure that any product supports the various digital ID schemes required or preferred for each country.

**The default type of digital signature provided by iSign is Advanced**. The legally required level of signature should be validated by a legal advisor. If you're unsure whether your document requires a Qualified Electronic Signature, **please consult your legal advisor**.

## Key considerations
- The eSignature applies to the entire document (it is possible to add appendices).
- The visual mark (signature image, signer name, ...) is optional.
- Digital signature only applies to electronic documents (**an electronically signed document that is printed loses its legal value**)

# What can you expect from iSign

Digital signatures offer several benefits to accelerate our business. They provide a modern and efficient method of signing documents online.

## Expected benefits

- **Save Time**: It can be frustrating to wait for other signees after printing documents. With digital signatures, you no longer have to wait for your manager to return from a holiday or conference to get that signature.

- **Reduce Costs**: Even today, many companies still print documents, sign them by hand, and deliver them to clients across cities or even countries. This process not only wastes time but also incurs significant costs. Embracing digital signature software is a crucial step towards making our organization paperless, saving on costs for paper, ink, printers, shipping, and storage.

- **Protect the environment**: Another advantage is environmental protection; digital signatures help reduce paper waste, which negatively impacts our environment.

- **Workflow efficiency**:With fewer delays, digital signatures enhance workflow efficiency. Managing and tracking documents become easier, requiring less effort and time. Many features of digital signatures expedite the work process. For example, email notifications remind individuals to sign, while status tracking provides visibility into the current stage of the document.


- **Security**: When it comes to signatures, authenticity and security are priorities. Digital signatures mitigate the risk of document duplication or alteration. They ensure that signatures are verified, authentic, and legitimate. Signers are provided with PINs, passwords, and codes to authenticate their identity and approve their signatures. Time stamping records the date and time of the signature, providing a trail for the document and minimizing the risk of tampering or fraud. Security features embedded in digital signatures ensure that documents have not been altered without authorization.

- **Legal validity**: Digital signatures provide authenticity and ensure that the signature is verified. They hold up in court just like any other signed paper document. Time stamping and the ability to track and easily archive documents enhance and simplify auditing and compliance.

In a nutshell, iSign will not alter your business workflow. Today, you might sign contracts on paper with blue ink. Tomorrow, with iSign, you will simply replace your usual "paper and blue ink" with the electronic signature solution. That's it. iSign will not modify how or when you sign contracts in your current process, making it very change management-friendly for your workflow. Of course, there are numerous advantages to using iSign over paper-based signatures.

## What iSign is not!

iSign is not a document storage or management solution; it is a platform for electronically signing documents. ICRC documents will continue to be stored and managed in Collaborative Spaces.

At the end of the signing process, documents MUST be downloaded to ICRC Collaborative Spaces (or other business line document management solutions) for preservation and deleted from iSign.

iSign is not designed for signing Strictly Confidential documents (refer to the ICRC Cloud Strategy). Strictly Confidential documents must be signed manually. For more information on document confidentiality, please refer to the IHT document and contact your IMA or IMCo.
