# Legal Considerations

Around the world, financial services organizations, insurance companies, healthcare providers, and more are moving away from handwritten signatures on contracts and other legally binding documents in favor of electronic signatures, due to the immediate efficiency and customer experience benefits. Financial institutions are experiencing a 66% reduction in missing files and a 92% reduction in errors from scanning paper documents. Moreover, electronic signature technology can now be easily integrated into many business applications and processes, further expanding its benefits to the business workflow.

The law applicable to electronic signatures is clear in many countries and has been established for some time, leading to increased e-signature adoption in recent years. It is a secure and legally binding solution in most cases, but there remains some confusion in the market about its legality.

In the EU, the validity and legality of electronic signatures are governed by *eIDAS* and the *GDPR*. Companies seeking to do business with individuals and other businesses across the EU should seek compliance with these bodies of law in order to gain legal standing through any electronic signature requirements.

In Switzerland, the validity and legality is governed by  *ZertES* which is a Swiss Federal law that regulates the conditions under which trusted service providers may use certification services with electronic signatures. ICRC electronic signature process is fully covered by ZertES. Additionally, this law provides a framework that outlines the provider’s obligations and rights as they apply to providing their certification services.

ICRC contracts have been adapted in 2020 or 2021 to recognize eSignature. The SoW was updated at that time with the following sentence *“The Parties also recognize as legally valid and binding the electronic execution/signature of this agreement and any amendment thereto through (i) digital signature module or tool or (ii) captioning the signature and inserting it electronically in the appropriate field/s"*. A review of our general terms and conditions (T&Cs) to include a similar clause in it is also planned.

# EIDAS

The eIDAS(electronic Identification, Authentication, and trust Services), which became an established EU regulation in July 2014, extensively covers laws around electronic identification, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, and the legality of electronic signatures. The idea behind eIDAS is to create a uniform law that applies to every member state within the EU so that electronic identification information could be accepted from every EU member state. Regarding electronic signatures, eIDAS segments digital signatures into three separate categories, each more secure than the last.

# GDPR

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe.

While the regulation doesn’t take aim at electronic signatures specifically, it adds additional rules and requirements that companies who implement electronic signature solutions should consider. This includes:

- Data security
- Encryption
- Consent
- Processing

Organizations seeking to utilize an electronic signature solution should understand the EU’s stance on these topics since they will be responsible for capturing and maintaining private information over an extended period in the form of contracts and digital agreements.

# ZertES

Organizations seeking to utilize an electronic signature solution should understand the EU’s stance on these topics since they will be responsible for capturing and maintaining private information over an extended period in the form of contracts and digital agreements.

On December 19, 2003, ZertES, the Swiss Federal law regarding the use of certification services with electronic signatures was approved into law. This legislation regulates the conditions in which trust service providers may use certification services with electronic signatures. Additionally, ZertES, provides a framework that specifies the provider’s rights and obligations when providing certification services. An electronic signature in the understanding of ZertES refers to data in electronic form, attached to or associated with other data in electronic form , serving to authenticate the former. So far, ZertES does not further specify how electronic signatures shall be technically implemented. However, to facilitate the international use of electronic signatures and their legal recognition, the Swiss Federal Council made international agreements and notably accepts electronic signatures, technically implemented as digital signatures following the following standards: XAdES, PAdES, CAdES.

# Criteria for legally binding signatures

As a general rule, legally binding e-signatures must:

- Show that signer truly is who they claim to be
- Show that the signer intended to sign electronically. The best way of proving this is to give the signer the option of signing on paper and letting them choose.
- The signer’s willingness to sign is demonstrated (e.g. an option to not agree is also present, such as a “cancel” button).
- The signer’s authenticity can be verified independently. This often means the presence of an email trail, timestamp, mobile phone number, and IP address. Two-step identification may also be helpful here for the purpose of attribution.

# Information security

Information security incidents can have other far-reaching consequences for the organization, such as the disruption of operations and support functions affecting business continuity, financial losses in case of fraud, lawsuits brought against the ICRC by individuals or entities, failure to comply with the ICRC's legal obligations and reputation damage and loss of trust by staff, beneficiaries, interlocutors and donors. The rationale and institutional basis for protecting information at the ICRC is formally established in the ICRC Information Security Framework (ISF) (including the Information Handling Typology), the Rules on Personal Data Protection and the ICRC Code of Conduct.

# Data Protection considerations

**Strictly confidential documents cannot be uploaded nor signed on iSign (Cloud platform).**

The Information Handling Typology Rules (IHT Rules) outline the criteria for classifying information and defining classification categories, and the handling rules to apply for all types of information. First and foremost, the responsible for the information must be clearly identified and must classify it, to enable recipients of the information to apply the appropriate handling rules. The IHT Rules apply throughout the lifecycle of information produced by – or in the possession of – the ICRC. There are four classification categories according to the sensitivity of the information: Strictly confidential – Confidential – Internal – Public.

Internal, confidential and strictly confidential information may only be shared with external staff under certain circumstances and conditions (see Section 4.2 Handling Rules). Please note that a Data Subject’s right to access will be determined not by the category of classification, but pursuant to Article 8 of the ICRC Rules on Personal Data Protection.
