# Different role around iSign and a signing ceremony

As explained in ISign  [What is iSign](https://https://icrc.github.io/what_is_isign.htl), not all documents require an eSignature, and not all users need an iSign account to eSign documents.

Below is useful information about the different roles within iSign:

## iSign as a signer
A signer (sometimes called signatory or recipient in iSign) is the person who actually signs a document during the signing ceremony. This could be either internal ICRC staff or an external party. The signer represents the entity for which they are authorized to sign a contractual document.

Signers don't necessarily need an iSign account or access to the platform; they only need to be notified via email when they are required to eSign a document.

### Signers can:

- Be notified via email that they have a document to review and eSign.
- Access, review, and eSign (or decline to sign) a document.
- Download the signed document and related evidence on their end, once the document is signed.
- Be notified when all parties have signed a document and download the final version.

### Signers cannot:

- Access the solution’s dashboard.
Monitor and/or change the transaction (e.g., signers list, signing order, preferences).

## iSign as a (Transaction) Owner

A (transaction) owner or advanced user in iSign is the person responsible for:


- Initiating a signing ceremony (uploading documents to the platform, positioning signing fields, defining signing rules, etc.).
- Convening the signatories (known as recipients in iSign).
- Following up and supporting the signing process (e.g., sending reminders when needed).
- Accessing monitoring dashboards and reports.
- Downloading the final version of the document and ensuring proper preservation and archiving for traceability and auditability.

At ICRC, examples of ‘owners’ can be AIMOs, Lead Buyers, Managers, or any person who wants to administer the solution for their team and manage the signing process.

iSign owners can only be ICRC staff (not external parties).

## iSign Support Contacts:

## How to get access to iSign

To deploy this service to (transaction) owners who need it, two processes run in parallel:

- An intentional deployment process aimed at opening this service to ALL document owners (owners of binding contracts with external parties). Work in progress.
- An on-demand process (request via the iSign ICT tile), enabling users to express their interest in the solution before the official deployment.

The process below shows the steps to gain access to iSign as a (transaction) owner:
