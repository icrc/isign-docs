# Different role around iSign and a signing ceremony

As explained in ISign  [What is iSign](https://https://icrc.github.io/what_is_isign.html), not all documents require an eSignature, and not all users need an iSign account to eSign documents.

Below is useful information about the different roles within iSign:

## iSign as a signer

A signer (sometimes called signatory or recipient in iSign) is the person who actually signs a document during the signing ceremony. This could be either internal ICRC staff or an external party. The signer represents the entity for which they are authorized to sign a contractual document.

Signers don't necessarily need an iSign account or access to the platform; they only need to be notified via email when they are required to eSign a document.

### Signers can:

- Be notified via email that they have a document to review and eSign.
- Access, review, and eSign (or decline to sign) a document.
- Download the signed document and related evidence on their end, once the document is signed.
- Be notified when all parties have signed a document and download the final version.

### Signers cannot:

- Access the solutionâ€™s dashboard.
Monitor and/or change the transaction (e.g., signers list, signing order, preferences).
