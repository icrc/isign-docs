# How to sing a document

An ICRC partner can be invited to sign a document with iSign.

Here's how to do it!

**1\. Access you email inbox**

The Transaction Owner created the transaction and added your email address as a signee. You should have received a new email in your inbox with details such as the transaction name and owner. Simply click *Go to documents*.
